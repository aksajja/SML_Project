Experiments being performed to discuss the "Computational - Statistical Tradeoff" for

1. Gaussian graphical models - by implementing Scarlet et al. (completed), Misra et al. (completed) papers.
2. Ising modles - by implementing Guy Bresler (completed), Klivans and Meka (yet to be completed) papers.

We compare the tradeoff by plotting the following 2D graphs (yet to be completed) -

1. Number of samples vs Risk/error. (fixed time)
2. Number of samples vs Time. (fixed risk)
3. Time vs Risk. (fixed samples)
